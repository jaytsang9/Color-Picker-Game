# Color-Picker-Game
The Color Picker Game is a fun way to test your knowledge of RGB values. This simple game takes advantage of basic HTML5/CSS3/Javascript for styling and animations.

Players can choose between two different game modes, easy and hard. Easy mode will present only 3 colors to choose from as opposed to the hard mode, which has 6 colors. 

Players can also reset colors if they find the color to be too difficult.
